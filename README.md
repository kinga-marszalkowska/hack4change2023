# hack4change2023 

[Hack4Change](https://hack4change.tech/) is a 48 hour eco Hackathon organized by Code:ME and Kami≈Ñski Institute. This is the repo of a project that was awarded ü•â place.

Team: Kinga Marsza≈Çkowska, Sylwia Puzio, Marek Kud≈Ça

# Task

Task was to create a solution in the area of wellbeing, climate, and/or tech to fight climate crisis or other problems we are currently facing.

# Problem

Our team decided to tackle the problem of the urban environment. 50% of world population currently lives in cities and in 35 years, the number is predicted to rise to 75%. We must learn how to adapt our cities to that challenge. Moreover, many of our cities in Poland need to undergo an eco-transformation. We need to plant more greenery, target public transport and renewable energy, and overall create cities pleasant to live in.  

# Solution

We've created a prototype of a game that will teach intuition on what is best for a city landscape. We decided to target the game to today's kids who will soon be planning the cities in which we're going to age. The game is a simulation of a city undergoing a change. It has real-life idnicators as ppm (air quality), energy mix (share of different energy sources), and wellbeing that allow the player to see the impact and consequences of their actions. The game can be played by teenagers and adults as well - you can gain points by walking, riding a bike, and participating in eco initiatives.
